# Linear Regression Explainer

An interactive visualization to help understand linear regression concepts

## Overview

Linear Regression Explainer is a web-based tool that helps you understand:

- How linear regression models work
- How different loss functions measure model performance
- How gradient descent finds optimal parameters
- The impact of outliers on model performance

## Features

- **Interactive visualization**: Adjust slope and intercept to see how the regression line changes
- **Real-time metrics**: See how different error metrics (SSE, MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) respond to changes
- **Gradient descent**: Watch the algorithm find the best parameters automatically
- **Outlier analysis**: Add outliers to see their impact on different metrics
- **Interactive data**: Add and remove data points by clicking on the plot
